        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Justin Nguyen.  I am currently attending school at University California Riverside. 
        As of right now, I am looking into the informational systems side of business. I'm typically a hard working person and strive
        to be the best that I can be.  In my free time, you can find me in the outdoors or being competitve in sports.  I'm definetely a 
        competitive person.  In high school, I played four years on varsity tennis and basketball. I also managed to take 9 AP classes during high school.
        Since high school, I've managed 3 jobs: a cashier associate, tennis coach, and a tennis official.  These jobs have taught me a lot about what it 
        takes to work in the real world.  I've learned a great number of things while working this job.  Along the many things that I've learned, I was taught 
        to always be early/on time, be professional, and always present a smile to make it seem like you want to be there.  I feel as though it's important to 
        have these qualities if you're going to work outside.<br><br>

        I've always been sort've interested in computers and business.  Meshing those two subjects together brought upon the idea of 
        me majoring in information systems.  In the past, I've been lucky enough to get some hands on experience with Workday and Villia Dolce.
        A few of my friends are programmers and have taught me a lot.  My dad majored in business information systems so I always had him as a mentor.
        One of my friends, Albert Ton graduated from Berkeley at the age of 19 and majored in computer science.  Right now, he is 19 years old and is 
        working a full time job making over 6 figures.  I aspire to be like my friend, ALbert and my dad.  Success doesn't come easy as they've told me and
        I don't intend on stopping until I have achieved success.  I want to strive to be the best person that I can be and to one day, give back to those who
        have helped me along the way.
  
        <br><br>

        Like I said, I'm typically a hardworking and gritty person. When I'm given a challenege, I step up to it.  I enjoy all sorts of challenges and will 
        push myself to the max if it means accomploshing a task at hand.  I'm free monday-sunday, all day.  Whenever duty calls, I will be free.  I'm an organized person
        and I like to plan out my day accordingly. Currently, I work as a tennis official for the USTA, or United States Tennis Association.  In this job, I monitor iPads and 
        computers to ensure that everyting is working fine and I make sure all athletes are playing fairly.  There's a lot that goes on in this job.  In the past, I traveled to
        UCLA, Utah, and New York for work.  This is a fun job for me and a great way for me to give back.  It takes a lot of responsibility to be a tennis official, and I'm glad
        to be apart of such a wonderful organization.  
        </p>
